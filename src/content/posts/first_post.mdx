Welcome to Narcissus, a blog about two people and their pets and their garden
and just about anything else that they want to write about.

What should you expect from future blog posts? Just about anything really. Our
only rule at this point is no pictures of us or our pets or anyone that we know.
Ashley might put up a recipe. Jason will most likely write about how he knows
nothing about plants. Posts will appear at random times and
random dates, our only guide being inspiration. Our goal here is to have
fun and share our life with the people that we love outside of the walls of
social media and big tech and the pressure to monotize hobbies.

All that to say, thanks for reading the first post! We're glad that you're here.
Here are some pictures of our favorite flowers from the spring and early summer:
