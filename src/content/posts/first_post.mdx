Welcome to Narcissus, a blog about two people and their pets and their garden
and just about anything else that they want to write about.

What should you expect from future blog posts? Ashley might put up a recipe or
have a post that is only pictures of our plants and veggies and peppers. Jason
might write about his ant allergies or his ignorance of plants. Posts will
appear when inspiration strikes. The topics might be as heavy as a cubic yard
of mulch or as light as an empty bag of dillo dirt. Our goal here is to have fun
and share our life with the people that we love outside of the walls of social
media.

All that to say, thanks for reading the first post! We're glad you're here.
Here are some pictures of our favorite flowers from the spring and early summer:
