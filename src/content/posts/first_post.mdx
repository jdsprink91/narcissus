Welcome to Narcissus, a blog about two people and their pets and their garden
and just about anything else that they want to write about.

Neither of us have written a blog before. Ashley's xanga journal floats in the
ether somewhere and Jason has a myspace that he'd like to remember fondly, but
doesn't want to revisit. Our inspiration came from two places: Jason's discovery
of a new-to-him technology, RSS feeds and Ashley's love of taking pictures of
the garden. We don't plan on sharing this with many people or on social media
really. If you're here, then either you stumbled upon this, and in that case
welcome, or you were sent this link by one of us and I'm grateful that you took
the time to click on the link and read through a paragraph or two. We promise
that our next blog post will be more exciting than this one.

What should you expect from future blog posts? Just about anything really. Our
only rule at this point is no pictures of us or our pets or anyone that we know.
Ashley might put up a recipe. Jason will most likely write about how he knows
nothing about gardens. These posts will appear haphazardly at random times and
random dates, pretty much when only inspiration hits. Our goal here is to have
fun and share our life with the people that we love outside of the walls of 
social media and big tech.

All that to say, thanks for reading the first post! We're glad that you're here.
Here are some pictures of our favorite flowers from the spring and early summer:
